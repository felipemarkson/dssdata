# DSSData


Welcome to DSSData's documentation. 

If you want to run a simple power flow, you can go to [Get started](./gettingstart). 

There is also a more detailed tutorial in [Learn DSSData](./tutorial) that shows how to run a simple but complete probabilistic power flow. 

The rest of the docs describe each component of  DSSData in detail, with a full [API Reference](./api).

Please, if you find some bug, report to us in our [Issues Section](https://github.com/felipemarkson/power-flow-analysis/issues).

DSSData is built on [OpenDSSDirect.py](https://github.com/dss-extensions/OpenDSSDirect.py). The documentation for this library can be found [here](http://dss-extensions.org/OpenDSSDirect.py/).
