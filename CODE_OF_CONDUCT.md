# DSSData's code of conduct

We expected that each people that interact with this project follows these basics guidelines inspired by the [Julia Community - Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/):

## Be respectful and inclusive

Do not use overtly sexual language or imagery. Do not attack anyone based on any aspect of personal identity, including gender, sexuality, politics, religion, ethnicity, race, age, or ability. Keep in mind that what you write or say in public is read or heard by many people who don't know you personally, so please refrain from making prejudiced or sexual jokes and comments â€“ even ones that you might consider acceptable in private. Ask yourself if a comment or statement might make someone feel unwelcomed or like an outsider.

## Give credit

All contributors are expected to respect copyright laws and ethical attribution standards. This applies to both code and written materials, such as documentation or blog posts. Materials that violate the law, are plagiaristic, or ethically dubious in some way will be removed from officially-maintained lists of resources.

If you believe one of these standards has been violated, you can file an issue on this repository or confidentially contact the manteiner Felipe Monteiro at fmarkson@outlook.com. Keep in mind that most mistakes are due to ignorance rather than malice.

## Be concise

Constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, but longer issues report or the missing of a [Minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) only difficuts the problem addressment. Consider writing a blog post if you feel that you have enough to say on a particular subject.

## Follow the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

- Treat others as you would like others to treat you.
- Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated.
- What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself.

## Any concern?

If you have a conflict or concern that requires resolution, please contact with the manteiner Felipe Monteiro at fmarkson@outlook.com.
